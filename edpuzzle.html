            <h2>Steps to Successfully Create a Class on Edpuzzle and Invite Your Students</h2>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>One of the tools that I've used to promote eLearning in the classroom is Edpuzzle. The company's motto is, "Turn any video into a lesson". With Edpuzzle's platform, you can embed formative and summative questions - both multiple choice and free response - into a video and check for a learner's understanding in real-time. Additionally, notes from the intstructor can be added if there are particular parts of the video lesson you'd like to highlight.</p>
                    <p>One of the adminstration teams that I previously worked for wanted to improve student engagement by providing more hands-on learning opportunities during our 80-minutes class periods by having less direct instruction. With this goal in mind, I set to creating a flipped chemistry classroom.</p>
                        <div class="highlightbanner">
                            <h5>A flipped classroom allows students to learn new content at home and then provides them with more time in class to explore the content through labs and problem-based challenges.</h5>
                        </div>
                    <p>When I presented this idea to my fellow chemistry teachers, I was met with hesitation at first. They had never tried to teach chemistry in this manner and I worked to provide them with examples of how I believed the new approach to teaching the curriculum could work.</p>
                    <p>The first task I had was to help the other chemistry teachers create classes on Edpuzzle and learn how to invite their students to the Edpuzzle class. That task was the foundation for the training video created and displayed below.</p>
                   
                <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>To create the training video that walks through how to create a class through Edpuzzle that you can enroll students in, I first started by developing a storyboard to make sure the key elements of creating a class were emphasized.</p>
                    <p>While this storyboard was not being presented to others, as this project was an individual project, I did like having a template to ensure the pace and delivery of content was clear. I started by thinking about the objectives I needed to meet by the end of the video and from there thought about the visuals that would best help me meet these goals.</p>
                    <p>The storyboard did go through multiple revisions as I continued to develop the training. I first started with a skeleton version of the storyboard that would allow me to meet my training objectives. After the key outline was there, I thought about the logistics of a seemless flow of information, and finally from there thought about how to keep learners engaged and clearly communicate where each objective as being met in the training. What is shown below is the final draft of the storyboard.</p>
                        <div class="centering">

                        </div>
                    <p>After creating the storyboard as a template, I began developing the training video. I used WeVideo to record my screen and narration. I edited the video through WeVideo and exported it to YouTube. The reason for exporting the video to YouTube instead of keeping it as an mp4 file was so that I could make the video more accessible to larger audience by adding in an option for subtitles. To create the subtitles, I uploaded the mp4 file to a program called Happy Scribe that autogenerated subtitles for the video as an SubRip Subtitle (SRT) file. I could then upload this SRT file to the YouTube video and make the video accessible to a larger audience.</p>
                    <p>The final training video is below:</p>
