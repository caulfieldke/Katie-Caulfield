            <h2>Steps to Successfully Create a Class on Edpuzzle and Invite Your Students</h2>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>A tool I've used in the classroom is Edpuzzle. The company's motto is, "Turn any video into a lesson". With Edpuzzle you can embed multiple choice and free response questions into a video to check for a learner's understanding in real-time. </p>
                    <p>A former supervisorâ€™s goal was to improve student engagement by providing more hands-on learning opportunities. With this goal in mind, I created a flipped chemistry classroom.</p>
                        <div class="highlightbanner">
                            <h5>A flipped classroom allows students to learn new content at home and then provides them with more time in class to explore the content through labs and problem-based challenges.</h5>
                        </div>
                    <p>I first needed to create classes on Edpuzzle and learn how to invite students to the class. That task is the foundation for the training video created and displayed below for use by other teachers.</p>
                   
                <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>I started by developing a storyboard to make sure the key elements of creating a class were emphasized, and the pacing and delivery of content was clear.</p>
                    <h6>Storyboard</h6>
                        <div class="centering">
                            <div class = "widthofiframe">
                                <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQcn_YDVMHwMGd-GLFPAMNO-NwK0BqOyMcNFm_kCY6uUbnukyAKW4UlH8W_j7COp5Jco7T8vtMYyHSY/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    <p>Translating the storyboard into a training video was done through YouTube, Happy Scribe, and WeVideo. Video editing was accomplished in WeVideo and then exported to YouTube. A SubRip Subtitle (SRT) file was created in Happy Scribe and then also exported to YouTube. This made the video accessible to a larger audience by providing the option for subtitles.</p>
                    <h6>The final training video is below:<h6>
