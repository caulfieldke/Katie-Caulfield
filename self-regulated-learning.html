            <h2>Helping Students Learn How to be Intentional During Their Learning Cycle </h2>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Numerous days during the school year are devoted to professional learning and pedagogy. I was selected to develop a training that would provide a meaningful professional learning experience to other teachers in our school.</p>
                    <p>The task was to design and implement a training focused on one of the five skills we're promoting with learners in all grade levels - critical thinking, collaboration, communication, creative thinking, and citizenship.</p>
                        <div class="centering">

                        </div>
                    <p>I authored a training detailing <b>self-regulated learning</b> , which promotes introspective communication for students.</p>
                        <div class="highlightbanner">
                            <h5>"Self-regulated learning refers to one’s ability to understand and control one’s learning environment." <br>- Teaching Execellence in Adult Literacy</h5>
                        </div>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>Using backwards design, we first planned what we wanted each learner to walk away from the training with:
                        <ul class="bullets">
                            <li>What the phases of self-regulated learning are</li>
                            <li>What each phase could look like in a classroom</li>
                            <li>Tangible resources to implement this in their classes</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>After establishing the objectives of the training, we discussed how each of us had implemented this concept of self-regulated learning in our classes. This discussion helped us delegate talking points to meet our objectives.</p>

                <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>During this collaboration effort I took on the roles listed below:
                        <ul class="bullets">
                            <li>Consolidated all the information provided by each presenter into one cohesive slide deck that was visually pleasing.</li>
                            <li>Provided relatable analogy to help target audience connect new concepts to prior knowledge.</li>
                            <li>Presented information in a clear and concise manner.</li>
                            <li>Aptly answered questions from the audience as they arose during the training.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
