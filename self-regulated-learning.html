            <h2>Helping Students Learn How to be Intentional During Their Learning Cycle </h2>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>When teachers return to school in the fall, there are numerous days devoted to professional learning and challenging ourselves to think about the pedagogy we apply with our students. Prior to our return for the 2022-2023 school, I was selected as an instructional leader amongst my colleagues and was asked to develop a training that would provide a meaningful professional development experience to other teachers in our school.</p>
                    <p>The task that was presented was to design and implement a training that focused on one of the five skills we're promoting with all learners in all grade levels - critical thinking, collaboration, communication, creative thinking, and citizenship.</p>
                        <div class="centering">

                        </div>
                    <p>The focus at the beginning of the year was to design lessons that highlighted <b>communication</b> and <b>collaboration</b>. My colleagues and I authored a training detailing <b>self-regulated learning</b> , which promotes introspective communication for students.</p>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>We used backwards design to determine the key takeaways we wanted to provide our colleagues with regarding self-regulated learning. We knew that we wanted each person who chose to attend our training to walk out with three main takeaways:
                        <ul class="bullets">
                            <li>What are the three phases of self-regulated learning?</li>
                            <li>What could each phase look like?</li>
                            <li>How could they implement this in their classes?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>After establishing the objectives of the training, we took to designing. We discussed how each of us had promoted this concept of self-regulated learning in our classes already and looked to which strengths and experiences with which each of us could speak.</p>

                <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>During this collaboration effort I took on the roles listed below:
                        <ul class="bullets">
                            <li>Consolidated all the information provided by each presenter into one cohesive slide deck that was visually pleasing.</li>
                            <li>Provided relatable analogy to help target audience connect new concepts to prior knowledge.</li>
                            <li>Presented information in a clear and concise manner.</li>
                            <li>Aptly answered questions from the audience as they arose during the training.</li>
                        </ul>
