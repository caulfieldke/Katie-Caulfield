            <h2>Creating a Virtual Escape Room to Engage an Audience </h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>On the first day of school I like to try and get the learners excited about what's coming in the year ahead by helping them draw on prior experiences with the content. In what would be considered a "normal year", I would do a hands-on experience that would help students have a little fun and get to know their classmates. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, however, this plan had to change. I had to come up with a way to get students excited about chemistry and engaging with their peers while all being in different locations.</p>
                <p>To meet these goals of fostering collaboration amongst learners and getting students excited, I collaborated with a colleague to develop a virtual escape room. Students worked in small, virtual break-out rooms to complete a variety of different tasks related to chemsitry. The gamification of chemistry concepts on the first day of school helped set a tone of fun and engagement for the remainder of the year. This activity went so well while in virtual learning, that we decided to adopt the activity as our first day of school activity for subsequent years.</p>
            <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>After deciding on creating a virtual escape room, it was time to start deciding on tasks for students to complete that would be meaningful to them, relate to chemistry, and keep them engaged with the activity. We decided to incorporate the most useful tool in chemistry as the basis for our escape room - <b>the Periodic Table</b>.</p>
                    <div class="centering">
                        <img src="periodic-table-link.png" alt = "Periodic Table" width = "600px"/>
                    </div>
                <p>To personalize the escape room to our target audience, we had students complete a series of tasks while spelling out the mascot of the high school - Falcons. <a href ="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L6hGDraRQir77b6TLhuYw8mchmxlPNMhkPlHdjPYoxA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">To see the brainstorming process for each activity click here.</a> Students had to select elements from the periodic table that would spell out this word and once they found the correct element and clicked on it, it would take them to an activity. At the end of each activity, a clue was provided in the form of another element's name. Students were encouraged to write these elements down to use to help them escape at the end of the activity.</p>

                <p>Google Sites &nbsp|&nbsp Google Forms &nbsp|&nbsp Google Docs </p>
            
            <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>Throughout the planning and implementation of this activity, I assumed many roles. Some of these were:
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li>Brainstormed creative activities that would get students excited about chemistry.</li>
                        <li>Designed activities to allow students to draw on prior knowledge without making them feel distressed about not knowing something on the first day of class.</li>
                        <li>Facilitated the activity simultaneously with nine different groups of three students each.</li>
                        <li>Reflected on the activity after the first year of implementation and making iterations to it as needed.</li>
                        <li>Determined how to take an activity designed in a virtual learning environment and still make it meaningful when students returned to in-person schooling.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                </p>
