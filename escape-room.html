            <h2>Creating a Virtual Escape Room to Engage an Audience </h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The gamification of chemistry concepts on the first day of school helps set expectations of engagement and collaboration for the year to come. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I had to develop a lesson that would get students excited and interacting with their peers in a distant learning environment. I collaborated with another chemistry teacher to construct a virtual escape room. This activity went so well virtually, that we decided to adopt the activity as our first day of school activity for subsequent years.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>To create the virtual escape room, we had to pick tasks for students to complete. Student progress in the escape room was tracked by using one of the most useful tools in chemistry - <b>the Periodic Table</b>.</p>

                    </div>
                <p>To personalize the escape room to our target audience, students progressed through the escape room by spelling out the mascot of the high school - Falcons. <a href ="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L6hGDraRQir77b6TLhuYw8mchmxlPNMhkPlHdjPYoxA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">To see the brainstorming process for each activity click here.</a></p>

            <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>Throughout the planning and implementation of this activity, I assumed many roles. Some of these were:
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li>Brainstormed creative activities that would get students excited about chemistry.</li>
                        <li>Designed activities to allow students to draw on prior knowledge without making them feel distressed about not knowing something on the first day of class.</li>
                        <li>Facilitated the activity simultaneously with nine different groups of three students each.</li>
                        <li>Reflected on the activity after the first year of implementation and making iterations to it as needed.</li>                        
                    </ul>
