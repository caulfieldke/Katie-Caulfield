            <h2>Communication with a Climbing Partner is Key</h2>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Have you ever felt the thrill of trying something really difficult and accomplishing it? Climbing brings me this sense of personal feat. Because climbing has brought me so much joy, I want to share that excitement with others and help them be safe while climbing. Clear communication between belayer and climber in top-roping is very important.</p>
                    <div class="highlightbanner">
                        <h5>Top-roping is a climbing style where a climber and belayer are attached to the same rope, and this rope passes through an anchor system. As the climber moves up the wall, the belayer takes up the slack in the rope so that if they were to slip, the climber would not fall.</h5>
                    </div>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>I wanted to provide a visual aid to help others remember common calls used while climbing. In my quick reference guide, I have provided both the climber and belayer calls so that people new to climbing would know what to say and what to expect to hear back as a response.</p>
