                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <img src = "qrg-climb-calls.jpg" alt="Infographic showing climbing call outs and responses" width="450px">
                    <p>Have you ever felt the thrill of trying something really hard and overcoming it? I feel that way every time I send a rock wall. Since September 2021, I have been exploring my interest in rock climbing both in a gym as well as outdoors. In both environments, I prefer to participate in a style of climbing known as <b>top-roping</b>. In this climbing technique, there is a <b>climber</b> and <b>belayer</b>. The climber is the individual moving up the rock wall and the belayer is the one on the ground who is taking slack from the rope connecting them.</p>
                    <p>Climbing has brought me a great sense of personal accomplishment. Everytime I make it up a wall that was previously stumping me, try a harder route grade, or learn a new technique that will improve my climbing skills, I think back to where I started in my climbing journey and realize just how far I've come.</p>
                    <p>Because climbing has brought me so much happiness and sense of accomplishment, I want to share that joy with others. Clear communication between belayer and climber in top-roping is very important in keeping everyone safe during the climb. There are some standard call outs used during top-roping that are taught during a basic skills course. When taking friends to try rock climbing, I've had to teach these call outs numerous times. I've constructed this <b>quick reference guide</b> to help teach this call outs for both climbers and belayers to provide this resources to friends in the future.</p>
                <h3>Process</h3>
                    <p>I wanted to provide a visual aid to help with remembering the call outs used while climbing. I knew that I wanted to provide both the climber and belayer call outs so that people new to climbing would know what to say and what to expect to hear back as a response.</p>
